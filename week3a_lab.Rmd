# Collaborators: 

# \textbf{Instructions:}

Before beginning this assignment, please ensure you have access to R and/or RStudio. 

1. Download the `week3a_lab.Rmd` file from Canvas. Open `week3a_lab.Rmd` in RStudio (or your favorite editor) and supply your solutions to the assignment by editing `week3a_lab.Rmd`. You will also want to download the `weather.txt` data file, containing a dataset capturing daily temperatures in Cuernavaca, Mexico during 2010. 

2. Replace the "Insert Your Name Here" text in the `author:` field with your own full name.

3. Be sure to include code chucks, figures and written explanations as necessary. Any collaborators must be listed on the top of your assignment. Any figures should be clearly labeled and appropriately referenced within the text. 

4. When you have completed the assignment and have **checked** that your code both runs in the Console and knits correctly when you click `Knit`, rename the R Markdown file to `YourLastName_YourFirstName_lab3a.Rmd`, and knit it into a PDF. Submit the compiled PDF on Canvas.

In this lab, you will need access to the following R packages:

```{r Setup, message=FALSE}
# Load some helpful libraries
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1: Data Cleaning 

In this problem we will use the `weather.txt` data. Import the data in **R** and answer the following questions.

\marginnote{\textcolor{red}{Hint: You might find the function \texttt{read.table()} useful here.}}

```{r}
# EDIT ME
```

## (a) What are the variables in this dataset? Describe what each variable measures. 

\marginnote{\textcolor{red}{Hint: There are five variables of interest here.}}

```{r}
# EDIT ME
```

## (b) Tidy up the weather data such that each observation forms a row and each variable forms a column. You might find the following functions helpful:

- `melt` 
- `mutate`
- `dcast`

```{r}
# EDIT ME
```

# Problem 2: Data Manipulation

In this problem we will use the `babynames` data. Use the data to answer the following questions. You can obtain the data from data.gov (look for NYC babynames dataset used in class)

```{r}
# EDIT ME
```

## (a) Which name(s) have been used every year?
```{r}
# EDIT ME
```

## (b) Which name had the largest percentage for any ethincity across all years?
```{r}
# EDIT ME
```

## (c) Which name recorded in the data set has been out of use for the longest time?
```{r}
# EDIT ME
```
